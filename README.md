# OJP-Practical2
Constructors and the this Keyword
Task 1: Creating the Product Class
● Create a Java class named Product to represent a product with attributes:
productId (int), productName (String), and price (double).
● Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these attributes.
● Use the this keyword to distinguish between instance variables and constructor
parameters.
● Implement a method called displayProductInfo to display the product
information (ID, name, and price).
Task 2: Using the Product Class
● In the main method, create three instances of the Product class with the
following data:
○ Product 1: ID = 101, Name = "Laptop", Price = 999.99
○ Product 2: ID = 202, Name = "Smartphone", Price = 499.95
○ Product 3: ID = 303, Name = "Tablet", Price = 299.50
● Display the information of all three products using the displayProductInfo
method.
Task 3: Additional Operations
● Implement a method in the Product class to calculate and return the discountedprice of a product. Allow specifying a discount percentage.
● Create a new Product object and calculate and display the discounted price witha 10% discount.
● Modify the Product class to include a static variable for tracking the total number
of products created. Implement a static method to retrieve this count.
● Display the total number of products created in the main method.
